## 🧐 What is my understanding of DevOps?
To me, DevOps is not just about tools like Jenkins or Docker; it is about bridging the gap between "It works on my machine" and "It works in production." It is the discipline of automating software delivery to make it faster, more reliable, and scalable.

## 🎯 Why am I starting DevOps & Cloud?
As a Computer Science student with a background in **Python (Django/FastAPI)** and **SQL**, I want to understand how to deploy the applications I build. I want to move beyond just writing code to owning the entire lifecycle of an application—from development to deployment and monitoring.

## 📍 Where do I want to reach?
By the end of these 90 days, I want to possess the skills to:
1.  Architect and deploy scalable infrastructure on AWS/Azure.
2.  Automate the deployment of my Python projects using CI/CD pipelines.
3.  Be job-ready for roles like **DevOps Engineer** or **Cloud-Native Developer** for my upcoming placements.

## ⏳ Consistency Strategy
* **Public Accountability:** I will post my progress on LinkedIn daily using `#90DaysOfDevOps`.
* **Code Daily:** I will push at least one commit to GitHub every day, even if it is just documentation or a small script.
* **Time Blocking:** I will treat this learning time as a mandatory college lecture that I cannot skip.

## 📊 Goals & Skills

### 3 Clear Goals for the next 90 Days
1.  **Containerization:** Dockerize my existing "Banking System" and "To-Do" Python applications.
2.  **Orchestration:** Deploy a highly available application on a Kubernetes cluster.
3.  **Automation:** Build a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins/GitHub Actions that tests and deploys code automatically.

### 3 Core DevOps Skills to Build
1.  **Linux & Shell Scripting:** To automate server management and troubleshoot production issues.
2.  **Docker & Kubernetes:** To master containerization and orchestration.
3.  **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** To provision cloud resources automatically.
